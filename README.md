app for managing remote insulin injection
currently the whole app is based on a phone that communicate to arduino board via bluetooth module.
the arduino board is connected to a "contour plus" glucometer that can remotly inject insulin in metronic insulin pumps.
the connection between the components is strait ford, the main issue is to calculate the insulin injection needed.
all modification and issues are welcome :-)
